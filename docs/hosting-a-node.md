### System Requirements

#### Authority Nodes

Below spec is the node configured in full node without logs.

| Resource  | Minimum Specification | Recommended Specification |
|-----------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| CPU       | 2 Core                | 4 Core                    |
| RAM       | 8 GB                  | 16 GB                     |
| Bandwidth | 10 Mbit               | 20 Mbit                   |
| Disk      | 300 GB NVMe SSD            | 500 GB NVMe SSD        |

#### Public Nodes

**Note**: For public nodes, it is essential to configure them with a robust and secure setup, including protection
against DDoS attacks and intrusion detection systems (IDS).

Below spec is the node configured in full archive node.

| Resource  | Minimum Specification | Recommended Specification |
|-----------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| CPU       | 8 Core                | 16 Core                   |
| RAM       | 16 GB                 | 64 GB                     |
| Bandwidth | 10 Mbit               | 20 Mbit                   |
| Disk      | 600 GB SSD            | 1 TB SSD                  |

### Important Considerations

#### Full Archive Node

A full archive node is a full node that stores all historical data of the blockchain, containing complete historical data of
all transactions and blocks, including forks and variations. Running a full archive node requires more resources than
running a regular full node, but it provides access to the complete history of the blockchain.

To run a full archive node, you need to set the `--disable-pruner` flag when starting the node. For example:

```shell
bin/thor --network main --disable-pruner
```

_As of 22nd April 2024, an archive node uses over **400 GB** of disk space._

#### Full Node

A full node is a node that stores the entire blockchain and validates transactions and blocks. Running a full node
requires fewer resources than running an archive node, but it still provides the same level of security and
decentralization.

Running a full node does not require any additional flags. For example:

```shell
bin/thor --network main
```

_As of 22nd April 2024, a full node uses **~200 GB** of disk space._

#### Full Node without Logs

**Note**: Logs pertain to the transfer and smart contract events recorded on the blockchain, meticulously stored
within an SQLite database for streamlined querying purposes. The `/logs/event` and `/logs/transfer` endpoints will be
deactivated when operating a node without logs.

To run a full node without logs, you need to set the `--skip-logs` flag when starting the node. For example:

```shell
bin/thor --network main --skip-logs
```

_As of 22nd April 2024, a full node without logs uses **~100 GB** of disk space._
